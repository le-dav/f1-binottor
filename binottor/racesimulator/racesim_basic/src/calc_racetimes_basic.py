    .. description::
    This basic simulation calculates the expected race times after every lap of a race under the assumption of a free
    track on the basis of the given parameters. Furthermore, it returns the estimated start and end race times for
    every FCY phase on the basis of their inserted start and stop race progress. The function is capable of considering
    FCY phases (VSC and SC). Therefore, it is assumed that the driver is directly affected by a FCY phase as soon as it
    appears. The slower FCY lap time is instantly applied, the safety car lap time is considered starting with the next
    lap. Driving through the pit under an active FCY phase leads to smaller time losses compared to normal race speed.
    Therefore, the modified time losses must be supplied if FCY phases are not None.

    THIS LIST IS USED FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE CORRECT LAP TIMES!
    When considering pit stops we have to check if they are performed during an active FCY phase. If this is
    the case we have to take modified pit stop driving time losses. Since these time losses are fixed, i.e. independent
    of when a FCY phase starts during a lap (as long as it is active for the entire pit stop driving) they should not
    be affected any further afterwards. Therefore, an extra array t_laps_pit is used to store them. In contrast, the
    normal lap times are modified by FCY phases according to the affected lap fractions, e.g. if a FCY starts at 30% of
    a lap.

    THIS LIST IS USED FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE CORRECT START AND END RACE TIMES OF FCY PHASES!
    To calculate the FCY start and end race times as exactly as possible we have to consider that pit stop time
    losses might have appeared before the FCY phase starts or ends. Therefore, the list t_pit_before_fcy_start_end
    stores these losses so that they can be considered later. We consider losses for this list only if the according
    event (e.g. inlap or outlap driving time losses) is completed before the start of the FCY phase respectively starts
    after the end of the FCY phase.
    For the start of a FCY phase we consider the outlap time losses if the FCY phase starts within the lap after the
    pit exit is passed (i.e. if the FCY phase starts at > lap_fraction_pit_outlap). Inlap time losses are not stored
    since the inlap driving is completed on the start finish line, i.e. it does not count for a FCY phase starting
    within this lap.
    For the end of a FCY phase we consider the outlap time losses if the FCY phase ends within the lap after the pit
    exit is passed (i.e. if the FCY phase ends at > lap_fraction_pit_outlap of the lap). Furthermore, we consider the
    inlap time losses if the FCY phase ends exactly at the end of the lap.
